# Master Tailwind UI

Welcome to the Master Tailwind UI tutorial series! In this video, we'll be demystifying UI components using Tailwind CSS. Let's dive in!

## Getting Started

I've already set up the project and its markup for you. Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository using the link provided in the video description.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:codedemystify/master-tailwind-uis.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd master-tailwind-uis
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. List the files to familiarize yourself with the project structure:

   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```

5. Navigate to the specific example you want to explore, for instance:

   ```bash
   cd 001-width-height-uis
   ```

6. Open the project in your favorite code editor; we recommend Visual Studio Code:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

## Development

Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Grab your coffee, tea, or favorite beverage and start writing some Tailwind classes! Happy coding!
